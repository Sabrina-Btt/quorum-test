## Discuss your strategy and decisions implementing the application. Please, considertime complexity, effort cost, technologies used and any other variable that you understand important on your development process.

For the implementation of the application, I adopted a modular approach to organize both the backend and frontend, prioritizing scalability and maintainability. On the backend, I used Node.js with Express, as it provides a lightweight, non-blocking runtime that's well-suited for handling I/O-bound tasks, such as reading large CSV files and processing the data. I structured the backend in separate modules, each responsible for a specific controller and its associated logic (cases), ensuring clear separation of concerns. The two primary routes, /bills/stats and /legislators/stats, expose the necessary endpoints to retrieve and manipulate the respective data.

In terms of complexity, the application is designed to handle smaller datasets efficiently, with asynchronous processing and optimized operations like filtering and mapping. It performs well in these scenarios, ensuring responsiveness and quick data handling. However, when dealing with larger datasets, the application may encounter a complexity of O(N²), which can impact performance. This presents an opportunity for further optimization, such as implementing more efficient algorithms to reduce nested operations and redundant filtering. With these improvements, the application can continue to perform well even with large volumes of data, maintaining its overall efficiency and responsiveness.

On the frontend, I opted for Next.js, which provides a powerful server-side rendering (SSR) capability for better SEO and faster initial load times. Combined with React and TypeScript, I ensured that the UI was dynamic, type-safe, and easy to maintain. The tables displaying data from both bills and legislators allow users to sort and filter entries efficiently, providing a clean and interactive interface.

The choice to implement sorting and filtering functionality directly in the frontend allows for a responsive user experience, without placing additional load on the backend. This also ensures that the application can handle varying amounts of data, offering an intuitive and performant interface for the user.

The decision to separate concerns into modular controllers on the backend and use Next.js on the frontend reflects my emphasis on maintaining a scalable, flexible application. Although handling large CSV files could have performance implications, I aimed to strike a balance between simplicity and efficiency, ensuring the application remains easy to extend, while minimizing complexity during development. This modular and structured approach also allows for future improvements, such as incorporating a database or adding more features, without significant rework.

## How would you change your solution to account for future columns that might be requested, such as “Bill Voted On Date” or “Co-Sponsors”?

To account for future columns such as "Bill Voted On Date" or "Co-Sponsors," I would adopt a flexible approach in both the backend and frontend to seamlessly integrate new data without requiring significant rework.

### Backend:

I would begin by ensuring that the backend can dynamically handle new columns in the data files. Instead of hardcoding the logic to manage specific columns (e.g., "vote_type" or "sponsor_id"), I would design the application to map the CSV data in a more generalized manner. Here's how I would approach it:

- **Dynamic Field Parsing**: I would create functions that read and map all available fields from the CSVs, rather than relying on hardcoded field names. This way, if a new column like "Bill Voted On Date" is added, the application would automatically parse it without modifying existing code.
- **Flexible Calculation Logic**: For features like calculating "Co-Sponsors," I would introduce a new field or array (if the CSV contains multiple co-sponsors) and modify the logic to handle this new data without affecting the rest of the application.

### Frontend:

On the frontend, I would ensure that the solution is flexible enough to handle new columns easily.

- **Dynamic Table Rendering**: The tables displaying the data should be configured to render dynamic headers and rows based on the available data. This could be achieved by iterating over the columns of the data object instead of manually specifying each column. As a result, when new columns are added, the table would automatically adjust to display them.

## How would you change your solution if instead ofreceiving CSVs of data, you were given a list of legislators or bills that you should generate a CSV for?

The modular structure of my code makes adding CSV generation straightforward. With controllers and logic separated, I can easily introduce a new route (e.g., /generate-csv) to handle CSV creation. Existing data validation and processing functions can be reused, ensuring consistency. The implementation would involve a utility function to dynamically convert a list of legislators or bills into CSV format, while a frontend button or UI element could trigger the download seamlessly. This approach minimizes changes to existing code and ensures an efficient, scalable solution.
